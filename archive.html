      <h3>Things I Am Currently Thinking About</h2>

      <ul>
        
        <li>
          Abstraction
          <label for="sn-abstraction" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="sn-abstraction" class="margin-toggle"/>
          <span class="sidenote">What is the proper level of abstraction that I need to model things I actually care about to make better decisions? How to do I measure the most impactful features to include? How can I ensure my models can be efficiently computed?</span>
        </li>
      
        <li>
          UAV (Drone) Detection (x2)
          <label for="sn-drones" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="sn-drones" class="margin-toggle"/>
          <span class="sidenote">I am interested in exploring how to effectively monitor both benign and potentially adversarial UAV traffic, especially in urban envrionments.</span>
        </li>

        <li>
          Reality-aligned Governance (x2)
          <label for="sn-governance" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="sn-governance" class="margin-toggle"/>
          <span class="sidenote">What would it look like to build policy frameworks that optimize for empirical outcomes and scale for the variation in constituents' abilities,  motivations, and risk tolerance? I will write on this soon.</span>
        </li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Things I Am Currently Enjoying</h3>

      <ul>

        <li>
          Home Automation
          <label for="sn-homeauto" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="sn-homeauto" class="margin-toggle"/>
          <span class="sidenote">I have just moved into a new place and have started enjoying home automation. I have started simple with security cameras, lights, and an air quality monitor. I am somewhat concerned with security and privacy. I may explore this topic more deeply in an upcoming blog post.</span>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cars_(franchise)" target="_blank">Cars</a>
          <label for="sn-cars" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="sn-cars" class="margin-toggle"/>
          <span class="sidenote">Yes -- the Pixar franchise. I have never actually seen any of them in full, and watched all three recently. I found them quite fun. </span>
        </li>
