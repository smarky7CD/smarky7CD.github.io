      <h3>Things I Am Currently Thinking About</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          UAV (Drone) Detection
          <label for="sn-drones" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="sn-drones" class="margin-toggle"/>
          <span class="sidenote">I am interested in exploring how to effectively monitor both benign and potentially adversarial UAV traffic, especially in urban envrionments.</span>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_hold_'em" target="_blank">Pot Limit Omaha</a>

          <input type="checkbox" id="sn-plo" class="margin-toggle"/>
          <span class="sidenote">I'm a hobbyist poker player. I have a good amount of experience playing No Limit Hold'em, but have recently become fascinated by PLO and its strategy.</span>

          Reality-aligned Governance

          <input type="checkbox" id="sn-governance" class="margin-toggle"/>
          <span class="sidenote">What would it look like to build policy frameworks that optimize for empirical outcomes and scale for the variation in constituents' abilities,  motivations, and risk tolerance? I will write on this soon.</span>
        </li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Things I Am Currently Enjoying</h3>
