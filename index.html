      <h2>Things I Am Currently Thinking About</h2>


      <ul>
      
        <li>
          Optimization Function
          <label for="sn-optfunc" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="sn-optfunc" class="margin-toggle"/>
          <span class="sidenote">How does one select a proper optimization function when analyzing trade-offs in policy proposals? Unconstrained utilitarianism-esque seems unrealistic and perhaps incoherent, while uber-individualistic functions also seem equally unappealing. What is an acceptable happy medium for building a just and flourishing society?</span>
        </li>

        <li>
          Reality-aligned Governance (x3)
          <label for="sn-governance" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="sn-governance" class="margin-toggle"/>
          <span class="sidenote">What would it look like to build policy frameworks that optimize for empirical outcomes and scale for the variation in constituents' abilities,  motivations, and risk tolerance? I will write on this soon.</span>
        </li>

      <h2>Things I Am Currently Enjoying</h2>

      <ul>

        <li>
          <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/" target="_blank">Home Labs</a>
          <label for="sn-homelab" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="sn-homelab" class="margin-toggle"/>
          <span class="sidenote">As I have mentioned, I just moved into a new place and have started enjoying home automation. I now have moved on and want to have a home server setup. I am looking for something in a micro form factor.</span>
        </li>

        <li>
          Slow-Pitch Softball
          <label for="sn-softball" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="sn-softball" class="margin-toggle"/>
          <span class="sidenote">I have recently joined a slow-pitch softball team. We take it seriously (e.g., keep statistics -- including advanced ones), but we also have fun (e.g., drink some beers in the dugout). I'm having a blast and getting some exercise.</span>
